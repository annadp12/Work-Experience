Charles Schwab - Digital Investing and Reporting Intern

During my time as a Digital Investing and Reporting intern at Charles Schwab I analyzed multiple large sets of new product data, never seen by the team. I Defined strategy and client experience to design the digital customer experience for the phase II launch of Schwab Investing Themes. I synthesized the data and created presentations to highlight important themes and trends. I worked on multiple projects at once, exceeding expectations by creating Executive Steering Committee slides for my managing director with two days’ notice. My presentation was so compelling that I was asked to create the slide deck for the following month as well. I also used the data findings to create a Partner Presentation to inform different sectors of Charles Schwab of new insights, deadlines, and strategy.


Calabrio - Salesforce Data Analytics Intern

As a Salesforce Data Analytics Intern, I paid close attention to detail while using strong analytics skills to transform confidential client data for a software conversion project. My 
supervisors referred to me as a “data sleuth” because of my ability to review multiple conflicting data sources and find the truth to populate the new salesforce application. I Supported Calabrio’s Data Clean Up and Data Integrity project by updating existing assets for consistency and aligning products to new SKUs. 


Hitachi Vantara and World-Wide Technology - Student Team Leader, Product Design

I was one of two students awarded the Henry Trueblood Grant by the Daniels School of Business for a personal safety proposal. I saw that there was a problem on campus and decided to make a change. I took afternoon sessions on coding and 3D printing in order to better understand the technology. This led me to work on a joint venture with the University of Denver, Hitachi Vantara, and World-Wide Technology, where I designed and produced a personal safety device and app that could be used on college campuses. I also developed proposals for go-to-market strategies and channels for product commercialization and was a key presenter when pitching ideas to Hitachi.


JCC's Camp CHI - Senior Counselor 

As a counselor at JCC’s Camp Chi, an overnight summer camp, I and a co-counselor were placed in charge of 15 young girls twenty-four hours a day. I worked cohesively with a partner and 
thought spontaneously and creatively to keep kids involved, excited, happy, and safe. I was rewarded for taking on a high level of responsibility and initiative by winning the “Best Junior Counselor” award from my supervisors and a promotion to Senior Counselor the following summer.
